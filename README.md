# JetpackUnspash
Jetpack is a suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on the court they care about.

This is a demo project for [GDG Kisumu](https://twitter.com/gdg_kisumu) for the Android Jetpack Meetup.
